# Predicting Inflection in Translation

In many models of machine translation, translations of sentences and documents are modeled as sequences of translations of words or other small phrases. In this laboratory exercise, you will learn some of the central ideas in machine translation by developing models of how individual English words—in the context of a sentence—translate into [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Czech_language). Czech is a morphologically rich language which uses [inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Inflection) to express many of the grammatical relations that English expresses using word order, syntactic structure, and function words. To illustrate this phenomenon consider how the following two sentences are translated into Czech:

 * [Fred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Jelinek) chased the <b>cat</b> .
 * The <b>cat</b> chased Fred .

Where English uses word order to distinguish the role *cat* plays in the two sentences, Czech uses inflection to express the same contrast:

 * Fred honil <b>kočku</b> . (*kočku* is the object)
 * Freda honila <b>kočka</b> . (*kočka* is the subject)

In this exercise, you will **learn a model from example translations to predict the most appropriate inflected form of a Czech translation given an English source word and its context.** This is, of course, only a small part of translation: we are not considering the problem of choosing the correct stem, nor are we composing words into sentences, but the central ideas of learning from example translations to generalize to how words are likely to translate in unseen test data is the fundamental concept in statistical approaches to machine translation.

To help you get started, we provide you with instructions for implementing a classification model based on a [multilayer perceptron](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/mlp.html), but the purpose of this assignment is to let you be creative in solving this problem, and you are encouraged to try out lots of different ideas (we list some suggestions below). To make things fun, you will be able to submit your system's predictions on a test set and compete with the other lab participants. At the end of the lab period, we will give prizes for the best performing systems!

## Getting started

 * Download [code and data](http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/www/jsalt-mt-lab.tar.gz) you will need to get started with this assignment.

### Provided data

We are providing you with training, development, and blind test datasets consisting of tuples $(x,c,y^\*)$ of an English source phrase ($x$), the English sentential context ($c$), and a Czech reference translation of the English source phrase ($y^\*$). You will also be provided with an English–Czech phrase table ($\mathscr{Y}$) which is guaranteed to contain the English source phrase and the Czech target phrase for every tuple we provide (of course, in a real system, you would need to deal with OOV words at test time).

At test time, you will be given a new set of tuples $(x, c)$ and asked to predict, for each of these, the corresponding $y$ from among all the translation options for $x$ that you find in the provided phrase table (we denote the set of translation options as $\mathscr{Y}(x)$).

## Data Formats

Training, dev, and test sets are all given in the same file format.
Each line will contain one training sentence split into three parts using a triple pipe ("|||") as the delimiter.
The first part is the <i>left context</i>, the middle part is the phrase of interest, whose Czech translation we wish to predict, and the third is the <i>right context</i>.
For example:
<center>there are ten countries  |||  along  |||  this river .</center>

Here "along" is the word we wish to translate into Czech. The reference translations are given in a corresponding file. For this example, the correct translation is <i>podél</i>.

## Baseline

The baseline you must implement (or beat) is a linear model that assigns a score to each phrase translation in the phrase table for a source language phrase *in the context of a full sentence*. That is, the baseline model assigns a score to a translation option in a source language context as $\textit{score}(x,c,y) = \mathbf{f}(x,c,y) \cdot \mathbf{w}$. For the baseline model, you are required to do two things: (i) engineer the feature functions $\mathbf{f}(x,c,y)$ (we discuss the required features below) and (ii) learn the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ from a corpus of a training examples which pair the sources phrases ($x$) and contexts ($c$) with a correct translation ($y^\*$).

If the training data we provided had "reference scores", we could use linear regression to solve this problem. However, all we know is what translation was used in various different contexts (and of course, what other translations the model could have used—the phrase table). Therefore, to estimate the parameters of the scoring function, we will optimize the following **pairwise ranking loss**:

$$\begin{align\*}
\mathscr{L}(x, c, y^\*) &= \sum_{y^- \in \mathscr{Y}(x) \setminus y^\*} \max(0, \gamma - \textit{score}(x, c, y^\*) + \textit{score}(x, c, y^-)) \\\\
 &= \sum_{y^- \in \mathscr{Y}(x) \setminus y^\*} \max(0, \gamma - \mathbf{f}(x, c, y^\*) \cdot \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{f}(x, c, y^-) \cdot \mathbf{w}) \\\\
  &= \sum_{y^- \in \mathscr{Y}(x) \setminus y^\*} \max(0, \gamma - (\mathbf{f}(x, c, y^\*) - \mathbf{f}(x, c, y^-)) \cdot \mathbf{w}) \\\\
\end{align\*}$$

where $\mathbf{f}(x, c, y^\*)$ is a function that takes a source phrase, context, and translation hypothesis and returns a vector of real-valued features and $w$ is a weight vector to be learned from training data. Here $\mathscr{L}(x, c, y^\*)$ is <i>per-instance</i> loss, which should be summed over all training instances to calculate the <i>total corpus loss</i>.

Intuitively, what this objective says is that the score of the right translation ($y^\*$) of $x$ in context $c$ needs to be higher than the score of all the other translations (the $y^-$) of $x$, by a margin of at least $\gamma$ (you can pick any number greater than 0 for $\gamma$; however note that if you set it to 0, there would be a degenerate solution which set $\mathbf{w}=0$ which would not be a very useful model). Thus, if ranks the wrong translation in context higher than the right translation, or if it picks the right answer, but its score is too close to that of the wrong answer, you will suffer a penalty.

Your learner should optimize this objective function using stochastic subgradient descent. That is, you should iteratively perform the update

$$\mathbf{w}_{(i+1)} = \mathbf{w}_{(i)} - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial \mathscr{L}(x, c, y^\*)}{\partial \mathbf{w}}$$

where $\alpha$ is some learning rate (the optimal value of the learning rate will depend on the features you use, but usually a value of 0.1 or 0.01 work well).

Despite all the notation, the stochastic subgradient descent algorithm for this model is very simple: you will loop over all $(x,c,y^\*)$ tuples in the training data, and for each of these you will loop over all of the possible wrong answers (the $\mathscr{Y}(x) \setminus y^\*$), you will then compute the following quantity:

$$\begin{align\*}
\mathscr{L}(x,c,y^\*) = \max(0, \gamma - (\mathbf{f}(x, c, y^\*) - \mathbf{f}(x, c, y^-)) \cdot \mathbf{w})
\end{align\*}$$

If you get 0, your model is doing the right thing on this example. If you compute any non-zero score, you need to update the weights by following the direction of steepest descent, which is given by the derivative of $\gamma - (\mathbf{f}(x, c, y^\*) - \mathbf{f}(x, c, y^-)) \cdot \mathbf{w}$ with respect to $\mathbf{w}$. Fortunately, this expression is very simple to differentiate: it is just a constant value plus a dot product, and the derivative of $c + \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}$ with respect to $\mathbf{b}$ is just $\mathbf{a}$, so the derivative you need to compute is simply
$$\begin{align\*}
\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}(x, c, y^\*)}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \mathbf{f}(x, c, y^\*) - \mathbf{f}(x, c, y^-)
\end{align\*}$$

The baseline set of features you are to implement is a set of <i>sparse</i> features following two feature templates, along with the four features provided for each phrase in the phrase table:

 * The four default phrase table features are the logs of the following four quantities: $p(e|f)$, $p(f|e)$, $p_{lex}(e|f)$, $p_{lex}(f|e)$.
 * A binary feature that conjoins (i) the source word, (ii) the hypothesis translation, and (iii) the previous word in the target sentence. Written as a string, a feature might be `src:bank_tgt:banka_prev:the`, and it would have a value of 1.
 * A binary feature that conjoins (i) the source word, (ii) the hypothesis translation, and (iii) the next word in the source sentence. An example feature string might look like `src:bank_tgt:banka_next:the`, and it would have a value of 1.

Note that this feature set is very sparse, yielding thousands of individual features. If you use Python, we recommend that you make use of `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` to represent your feature vectors. There are equivalent sparse vector data types in almost every programming language.

To earn 7 points on this assignment, you must **implement a the described learning algorithm using the above features**
 so that it is capable of predicting which Czech translation of a highlighted source phrase is most likely given its context.

## Default model

To help get you started, we are providing a default model that four important features, $\log p(e|f)$, $\log p(f|e)$, $\log p_{lex}(e|f)$, and $\log p_{lex}(f|e)$. Furthermore, it uses the simple weight vector $(1\;0\;0\;0)$. Therefore it always simply sorts the candidates by $p(e \mid f)$. Thus, the default model is not sensitive to context.

## The Challenge

As discussed above, our baseline reranker simply sorts the candidates by $p(e|f)$. In our simple "bank" example, it would always then suggest <i>banka</i> over <i>břeh</i>.

Here are some ideas:

 * Add $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ regularization to prevent the learner from assigning too much importance to rare features.
 * Use convolutional neural networks to automatically learn to discriminate translations from context ([paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02357v1.pdf))
 * Leverage dependency and POS information to predict case ([paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1174.pdf))
 * Use lexical context and syntactic information ([paper](https://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W08/W08-0302.pdf))
 * Learn bilingual word vectors from [parallel data]({{site.baseurl}}/parallel.encs) ([paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfaruqui/papers/eacl14-vectors.pdf))
